It was provably the best algorithm for well-structured optimization tasks. such as non-smooth convex optimization in large dimensions. But then came quantum computers with their fancy superpositions, pulling off amazing feats of computation. So questions of the form &ldquo;Is this the best algorithm we have?&rdquo; had to be asked all over again.</p><p>In this talk we will take a look at gradient descent, at the task of non-smooth convex optimization, and we&rsquo;ll show that quantum computers can&rsquo;t improve upon gradient descent in general.</p></article><article><h2>Lower Bounds in Algebraic Circuit Complexity</h2><h5 id=abstract>Abstract:</h5><p>Algebraic circuits and formulas are the standard computational models for computing multivariate polynomials. They are similar to boolean circuits and formulas except that in this case, gates are labelled by &lsquo;+&rsquo; or &lsquo;x&rsquo;. Another important model is that of an algebraic branching program (ABP), which is an intermediate model between circuits and formulas in terms of computational power. I will begin the talk by defining these models of computation formally, and then survey some of the results that have helped shape our understanding of algebraic circuits.</p><p>Along the way, we will see that even though very strong lower bounds are known against various structured models, the best known lower bound against general algebraic circuits is barely super-linear [Str73, BS83]. This was also the best known bound against ABPs. On the other hand, against formulas, the best known lower bound was $\Omega(n^2/log n)$ [Kal85, SY11] for multilinear polynomials (which is the interesting case). In a joint work with Mrinal Kumar, Adrian She and Ben Lee Volk, we improved the bounds for ABPs and formulas by showing a quadratic lower bound against both these models. We will see the proof ideas of this result in some detail.</p></article><article><h2>National Quantum Science and Technology Symposium</h2></article><article><h2>Shortest Paths in Time-varying Networks</h2><h5 id=abstract>Abstract:</h5><p>Suppose you are given the traffic situation on each road of your city and you want to find the quickest way to your workplace from your home. The city&rsquo;s road network can be modelled by a graph whose edge weights represent the amount of traffic on the roads. Now the problem boils down to computing a shortest path in this graph, which can be solved by standard algorithms (Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm, Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm). However, in most practical scenarios, the traffic typically varies with time. So we have a graph whose edge weights are functions of time. We will see that this new setting poses some interesting mathematical questions and computational challenges, some of which have real-world implications.</p><h5 id=video>Video</h5><p><em>Need IIIT IDs for access.</em></p><div style=max-width:640px><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe width=640 height=360 src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/07fae963-7f1b-485b-b89a-d9aa68d98400?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style=border:none;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;height:100%;max-width:100%></iframe></div></div></article><div class=container><div class="d-flex justify-content-between py-4 my-4 border-top"><p>Â© 2021 IIIT Hyderabad.
