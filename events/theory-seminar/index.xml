Model counting is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications in domains such as quantified information leakage, probabilistic reasoning, network reliability, neural network verification, and more. Owing to the #P-hardness of the problems, Stockmeyer initiated the study of the complexity of approximate counting and show that $\log n$ calls to an NP oracle are necessary and sufficient to achieve tight guarantees.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Point Functions meet Secure Multiparty Computation</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/distributed_point_functions_meet_secure_multiparty_computation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 14:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/distributed_point_functions_meet_secure_multiparty_computation/</guid><description>Abstract: Secure Multiparty Computation allows two or more computing parties to collaboratively compute some function on their (secret) inputs while keeping their inputs secret. MPC has a wide range of applications for privacy-protecting systems. However, unfortunately, the efficiency of MPC protocols is still somewhat limited. Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) are cryptographic primitives allowing us to share a standard-basis vector among two or more parties succinctly. In this talk, we present novel techniques which use DPFs to construct efficient MPC protocols.</description></item><item><title>How to store a graph?</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/how_to_store_a_graph/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/how_to_store_a_graph/</guid><description>Abstract How does one store a graph in the database? Typically the vertices are labelled by a set {1, 2, &amp;hellip;, n}. The edges can be denoted in many different ways: adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, adjacency list, to name a few. But what if the vertices are labelled in a more creative way, such that the labels of the vertices themselves denote their adjacencies? This eliminates the need for storing the edges!</description></item><item><title>Demystifying the border of depth-3 algebraic circuits</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/demystifying-the-border-of-depth-3-algebraic-circuits/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/demystifying-the-border-of-depth-3-algebraic-circuits/</guid><description>Abstract Border (or approximative) complexity of polynomials plays an integral role in GCT approach to P!=NP. This raises an important open question: can a border circuit be efficiently debordered (i.e. convert from approximative to exact)? Or, could the approximation involve exponential-precision which may not be efficiently simulatable? Circuits of depth 3 or 4, are a good testing ground for this question.
Recently, (Kumar ToCT'20) proved the universal power of the border of top-fanin-2 depth-3 circuits.</description></item><item><title>Quantum weirdness in query-to-communication simulation and the role of symmetry</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/quantum-weirdness-in-query-to-communication-simulation-and-the-role-of-symmetry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/quantum-weirdness-in-query-to-communication-simulation-and-the-role-of-symmetry/</guid><description>Abstract Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson (STOC'98) showed that for every Boolean function $f : {0,1}^n \to {0,1}$ and $G \in {AND_2, XOR_2}$, the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of the composed function (f \circ G) equals O(Q(f) log n), where Q(f) denotes the bounded-error quantum query complexity of f. This is known as the BCW Simulation Theorem. This is in contrast with the classical setting, where it is easy to show that $R^{cc}(f \circ G) \leq 2R(f)$, where R^{cc} and R denote bounded-error communication and query complexity, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A(n almost) Universal Algorithm for Global Minimum Cut</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/an_almost_universal_algorithm_for_global_minimum_cut-copy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/an_almost_universal_algorithm_for_global_minimum_cut-copy/</guid><description>Abstract Consider the following 2-respecting min-cut problem: Given a weighted graph G and its spanning tree T, find the minimum cut among the cuts that contain at most two edges in T. This problem is an important subroutine in Karger&amp;rsquo;s celebrated randomized near-linear-time min-cut algorithm [STOC'96]. I will present a new approach for this problem which can be easily implemented in many settings, such as sequential, cut-query, streaming, PRAM, distributed CONGEST, and 2-party communication protocol, each achieving the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>QBF Solving: Advantages and disadvantages of different approaches</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/qbf_solving_advantages_and_disadvantages_of_different_approaches/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/qbf_solving_advantages_and_disadvantages_of_different_approaches/</guid><description>Abstract: Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is believed to be hard in the worst case. However, many heuristic based software can solve industrial SAT instances with tens of thousands of variables in a reasonable amount of time. Theoretical study of these heuristics helps us in understanding the type of formulas these software can and can&amp;rsquo;t solve in polynomial time, and in comparing different software.
Motivated by the success of SAT solving software, software have been created for an even harder problem: checking whether a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) is true or false.</description></item><item><title>Can Quantum Computers Outperform Gradient Descent?</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/can_quantum_computers_outperform_gradient_descent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/can_quantum_computers_outperform_gradient_descent/</guid><description>Abstract: Gradient descent is a marvel of an algorithm that allows very efficient optimization in high-dimensional spaces. It was provably the best algorithm for well-structured optimization tasks. such as non-smooth convex optimization in large dimensions. But then came quantum computers with their fancy superpositions, pulling off amazing feats of computation. So questions of the form &amp;ldquo;Is this the best algorithm we have?&amp;rdquo; had to be asked all over again.
In this talk we will take a look at gradient descent, at the task of non-smooth convex optimization, and we&amp;rsquo;ll show that quantum computers can&amp;rsquo;t improve upon gradient descent in general.</description></item><item><title>Functional Lower Bounds for Restricted Arithmetic Circuits of Depth Four</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/functional-lower-bounds-for-restricted-arithmetic-circuits-of-depth-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 16:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/functional-lower-bounds-for-restricted-arithmetic-circuits-of-depth-4/</guid><description>Abstract: One of the major motivations to study Arithmetic/Algebraic Circuit Complexity was due to the “slow” progress in proving lower bounds in Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on some empirical evidence, researchers believed that the power of underlying algebra and the possibility of cancellations could help understand computations on the algebraic setting.
In this talk we shall outline some of the connections between Boolean Circuit Complexity and Algebraic Circuit Complexity. In particular (by building upon some previous work [due to Yao, Beigel &amp;amp; Tarui, Forbes, Kumar &amp;amp; Saptharishi], we shall present a path towards proving stronger (nonuniform) ACC0 lower bounds via proving “functional” lower bounds in the algebraic setting.</description></item><item><title>Lower Bounds in Algebraic Circuit Complexity</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/lower_bounds_in_algebraic_circuit_complexity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/lower_bounds_in_algebraic_circuit_complexity/</guid><description>Abstract: Algebraic circuits and formulas are the standard computational models for computing multivariate polynomials. They are similar to boolean circuits and formulas except that in this case, gates are labelled by &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;. Another important model is that of an algebraic branching program (ABP), which is an intermediate model between circuits and formulas in terms of computational power. I will begin the talk by defining these models of computation formally, and then survey some of the results that have helped shape our understanding of algebraic circuits.</description></item><item><title>Shortest Paths in Time-varying Networks</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/shortest_paths_in_time_varying_networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/shortest_paths_in_time_varying_networks/</guid><description>Abstract: Suppose you are given the traffic situation on each road of your city and you want to find the quickest way to your workplace from your home. The city&amp;rsquo;s road network can be modelled by a graph whose edge weights represent the amount of traffic on the roads. Now the problem boils down to computing a shortest path in this graph, which can be solved by standard algorithms (Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm, Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm).</description></item><item><title>Algorithmizing the Multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel Lemma</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/algorithmizing_the_multiplicity_schwartz-zippel_lemma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/algorithmizing_the_multiplicity_schwartz-zippel_lemma/</guid><description>Abstract The degree maxim states that any non-zero univariate polynomial of degree at most d has at most d roots (counted with multiplicity). A generalization of this to the multivariate setting, proved by Dvir-Kopparty-Saraf-Sudan asserts that over any field, a low-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a sufficiently large product set. It has found numerous applications; in particular, in the definition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty-Saraf-Yekhanin.</description></item><item><title>Fast Multivariate Multipoint Evaluation</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/fast_multivariate_multipoint_evaluation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/fast_multivariate_multipoint_evaluation/</guid><description>Abstract Multipoint evaluation is the computational task of evaluating a polynomial given as a list of coefficients at a given set of inputs. A straightforward algorithm for this problem is to just iteratively evaluate the polynomial at each of the inputs. The question of obtaining faster-than-naive (and ideally, close to linear time) algorithms for this problem is a natural and fundamental question in computational algebra. In addition to its own inherent interest, faster algorithms for multipoint evaluation are closely related to fast algorithms for other natural algebraic questions like polynomial factorization and modular composition.</description></item><item><title>Godsil type identities of the multi-variate independence polynomials of graphs from heaps theory.</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/godsil_type_identities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/godsil_type_identities/</guid><description>Abstract Given a simple graph G, one can associate a monoid called Cartier–Foata monoid of G (denote it as CF(G)). It is also called trace monoid or partially commutative monoid of G in the literature. Viennot introduced &amp;ldquo;heaps of pieces&amp;rdquo; that give geometric interpretations of elements of CF(G). One can show that the monoid of heaps of pieces in the vertices of G with the concurrency relation determined by G is equivalent to CF(G).</description></item><item><title>Homomorphism testing over Non-Abelian groups</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/homomorphism-testing-over-non-abelian-groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/homomorphism-testing-over-non-abelian-groups/</guid><description>Abstract Homomorphism testing is the problem of checking if a function between two groups is correlated with some homomorphism. Such tests are widely used in constructing probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) and many other areas of computer science.
In this talk, we will look at the setting of unitary-matrix valued functions on non-abelian groups. We will see what the famous Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld (BLR) test implies in this setup, and present our results on derandomizing this test.</description></item><item><title>Leakage-Resilience Meets Incompressibility</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/leakage-resilience-meets-incompressibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/leakage-resilience-meets-incompressibility/</guid><description>Abstract Leakage-resilient cryptography aims to maintain security even if an adversary gains partial knowledge of the secret key while having access to the entire ciphertext. In typical scenarios, this involves designing systems that can withstand side-channel attacks, where small but potentially crucial bits of the secret key might be leaked through unintended channels such as timing information or power consumption patterns. Incompressible cryptography, on the other hand, offers security in situations where the adversary can obtain the entire secret key but only a portion of the ciphertext.</description></item><item><title>Making a Trifference</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/making-a-trifference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/making-a-trifference/</guid><description>Abstract A subset C⊆{0,1,2}^n is said to be a trifferent code (of block length n) if for every three distinct codewords x,y,z∈C, there is a coordinate i∈{1,2,…,n} where they all differ, that is, {x(i),y(i),z(i)} is same as {0,1,2}. Let T(n) denote the size of the largest trifferent code of block length n. Understanding the asymptotic behavior of T(n) is closely related to determining the zero-error capacity of the (3/2)-channel defined by Elias'58, and is a long-standing open problem in the area.</description></item><item><title>Polynomial Calculus sizes over the Boolean and Fourier bases are incomparable</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/polynomial-calculus-sizes-over-boolean-and-fourier-bases-are-incomparable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/polynomial-calculus-sizes-over-boolean-and-fourier-bases-are-incomparable/</guid><description>Abstract Proof theory is a foundational field of modern mathematics, dealing with study of the structure of mathematical proofs. It has a rich history starting with Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s intuitive notions of a rigorous proof, Euclid&amp;rsquo;s semi-formal system of logic underlying geometry, Frege&amp;rsquo;s notions of a formal system of logic with a complete set of inference rules, Hilbert&amp;rsquo;s attempted program to formalize the whole of mathematics, Gödel&amp;rsquo;s incompleteness results that put an end to this program, and finally Turing&amp;rsquo;s seminal paper building on Gödel&amp;rsquo;s work defining a formal notion of a computer and laying the foundations of most of theoretical computer science as we know it today.</description></item><item><title>Trading determinism for noncommutativity in Singularity testing</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/trading-determinism-for-noncommutativity-in-singularity-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/trading-determinism-for-noncommutativity-in-singularity-testing/</guid><description>Abstract Finding an efficient deterministic algorithm for symbolic determinant identity testing (SDIT) is one of the most important problems in computational complexity and very little is known about it. Around 2016, two independent research groups solved the noncommutative version of the problem in deterministic polynomial time (Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson 2016, Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam 2017) using very different techniques. In this talk, we will discuss a different algorithm for this problem based on noncommutative polynomial identity testing.</description></item></channel></rss>
