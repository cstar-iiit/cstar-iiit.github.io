      <description>Abstract How does one store a graph in the database? Typically the vertices are labelled by a set {1, 2, &amp;hellip;, n}. The edges can be denoted in many different ways: adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, adjacency list, to name a few. But what if the vertices are labelled in a more creative way, such that the labels of the vertices themselves denote their adjacencies? This eliminates the need for storing the edges!</description>

      <title>Demystifying the border of depth-3 algebraic circuits</title>

      <description>Abstract Border (or approximative) complexity of polynomials plays an integral role in GCT approach to P!=NP. This raises an important open question: can a border circuit be efficiently debordered (i.e. convert from approximative to exact)? Or, could the approximation involve exponential-precision which may not be efficiently simulatable? Circuits of depth 3 or 4, are a good testing ground for this question.
Recently, (Kumar ToCT&#39;20) proved the universal power of the border of top-fanin-2 depth-3 circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum weirdness in query-to-communication simulation and the role of symmetry</title>

      <description>Abstract Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson (STOC&#39;98) showed that for every Boolean function $f : {0,1}^n \to {0,1}$ and $G \in {AND_2, XOR_2}$, the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of the composed function (f \circ G) equals O(Q(f) log n), where Q(f) denotes the bounded-error quantum query complexity of f. This is known as the BCW Simulation Theorem. This is in contrast with the classical setting, where it is easy to show that $R^{cc}(f \circ G) \leq 2R(f)$, where R^{cc} and R denote bounded-error communication and query complexity, respectively.</description>

      <title>A(n almost) Universal Algorithm for Global Minimum Cut</title>
      <link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/an_almost_universal_algorithm_for_global_minimum_cut-copy/</link>

      <guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/an_almost_universal_algorithm_for_global_minimum_cut-copy/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Consider the following 2-respecting min-cut problem: Given a weighted graph G and its spanning tree T, find the minimum cut among the cuts that contain at most two edges in T. This problem is an important subroutine in Karger&amp;rsquo;s celebrated randomized near-linear-time min-cut algorithm [STOC&#39;96]. I will present a new approach for this problem which can be easily implemented in many settings, such as sequential, cut-query, streaming, PRAM, distributed CONGEST, and 2-party communication protocol, each achieving the state of the art.</description>

      <title>QBF Solving: Advantages and disadvantages of different approaches</title>

      <description>Abstract: Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is believed to be hard in the worst case. However, many heuristic based software can solve industrial SAT instances with tens of thousands of variables in a reasonable amount of time. Theoretical study of these heuristics helps us in understanding the type of formulas these software can and can&amp;rsquo;t solve in polynomial time, and in comparing different software.
Motivated by the success of SAT solving software, software have been created for an even harder problem: checking whether a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) is true or false.</description>

      <title>Can Quantum Computers Outperform Gradient Descent?</title>
      <link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/can_quantum_computers_outperform_gradient_descent/</link>

      <guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/can_quantum_computers_outperform_gradient_descent/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: Gradient descent is a marvel of an algorithm that allows very efficient optimization in high-dimensional spaces. It was provably the best algorithm for well-structured optimization tasks. such as non-smooth convex optimization in large dimensions. But then came quantum computers with their fancy superpositions, pulling off amazing feats of computation. So questions of the form &amp;ldquo;Is this the best algorithm we have?&amp;rdquo; had to be asked all over again.
In this talk we will take a look at gradient descent, at the task of non-smooth convex optimization, and we&amp;rsquo;ll show that quantum computers can&amp;rsquo;t improve upon gradient descent in general.</description>

      <title>Functional Lower Bounds for Restricted Arithmetic Circuits of Depth Four</title>
      <link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/functional-lower-bounds-for-restricted-arithmetic-circuits-of-depth-4/</link>

      <guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/functional-lower-bounds-for-restricted-arithmetic-circuits-of-depth-4/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: One of the major motivations to study Arithmetic/Algebraic Circuit Complexity was due to the “slow” progress in proving lower bounds in Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on some empirical evidence, researchers believed that the power of underlying algebra and the possibility of cancellations could help understand computations on the algebraic setting.
In this talk we shall outline some of the connections between Boolean Circuit Complexity and Algebraic Circuit Complexity. In particular (by building upon some previous work [due to Yao, Beigel &amp;amp; Tarui, Forbes, Kumar &amp;amp; Saptharishi], we shall present a path towards proving stronger (nonuniform) ACC0 lower bounds via proving “functional” lower bounds in the algebraic setting.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds in Algebraic Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/lower_bounds_in_algebraic_circuit_complexity/</link>

      <guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/lower_bounds_in_algebraic_circuit_complexity/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: Algebraic circuits and formulas are the standard computational models for computing multivariate polynomials. They are similar to boolean circuits and formulas except that in this case, gates are labelled by &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;. Another important model is that of an algebraic branching program (ABP), which is an intermediate model between circuits and formulas in terms of computational power. I will begin the talk by defining these models of computation formally, and then survey some of the results that have helped shape our understanding of algebraic circuits.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Suppose you are given the traffic situation on each road of your city and you want to find the quickest way to your workplace from your home. The city&amp;rsquo;s road network can be modelled by a graph whose edge weights represent the amount of traffic on the roads. Now the problem boils down to computing a shortest path in this graph, which can be solved by standard algorithms (Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm, Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm).</description>

      <title>Algorithmizing the Multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel Lemma</title>

      <guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/algorithmizing_the_multiplicity_schwartz-zippel_lemma/</guid>
      <description>Abstract The degree maxim states that any non-zero univariate polynomial of degree at most d has at most d roots (counted with multiplicity). A generalization of this to the multivariate setting, proved by Dvir-Kopparty-Saraf-Sudan asserts that over any field, a low-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a sufficiently large product set. It has found numerous applications; in particular, in the definition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty-Saraf-Yekhanin.</description>

      <title>Fast Multivariate Multipoint Evaluation</title>

      <description>Abstract Multipoint evaluation is the computational task of evaluating a polynomial given as a list of coefficients at a given set of inputs. A straightforward algorithm for this problem is to just iteratively evaluate the polynomial at each of the inputs. The question of obtaining faster-than-naive (and ideally, close to linear time) algorithms for this problem is a natural and fundamental question in computational algebra. In addition to its own inherent interest, faster algorithms for multipoint evaluation are closely related to fast algorithms for other natural algebraic questions like polynomial factorization and modular composition.</description>

      <description>Abstract Given a simple graph G, one can associate a monoid called Cartier–Foata monoid of G (denote it as CF(G)). It is also called trace monoid or partially commutative monoid of G in the literature. Viennot introduced &amp;ldquo;heaps of pieces&amp;rdquo; that give geometric interpretations of elements of CF(G). One can show that the monoid of heaps of pieces in the vertices of G with the concurrency relation determined by G is equivalent to CF(G).</description>
