The cybersecurity field is becoming important because of the growing dependence on computers, the Internet, wireless communications standards (e.g., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), as well as the increasing number of &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; IoT devices. Due to a variety of reasons, cybersecurity has become one of the major challenges of the modern IT age.</description></item><item><title>Shatrunjay Rawat</title><link>http://example.org/people/faculty/shatrunjayrawat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/people/faculty/shatrunjayrawat/</guid><description>Testing</description></item><item><title>Test Student</title><link>http://example.org/people/students/student/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/people/students/student/</guid><description>Testing</description></item><item><title>Theory for Machine Learning</title><link>http://example.org/research-areas/theory-for-ml/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/research-areas/theory-for-ml/</guid><description>In this group, we are interested in theoretical aspects of algorithms that relate specifically to machine learning and related domains such as vision. Some of the research problems consist of designing of better optimization models, solvers and provable guarantee of convergence. Learning part of machine learning often corresponds to minimizing a suitable loss function defined for a labelled data. Hence, optimization methods lies at the center of machine learning research in theory and algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Ankit Gangwal</title><link>http://example.org/people/faculty/ankitgangwal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/people/faculty/ankitgangwal/</guid><description>Dr. Ankit Gangwal is an Assistant Professor at IIIT Hyderabad, India.

These machines, known as quantum computers are radically different from their classical counterparts. A major emphasis is given to the design of new algorithms that highlight the differences between classical and quantum computation in the different models of quantum computation. In the near term, we intend to develop algorithms with practical applications for quantum computers that will be available soon.</description></item><item><title>Shantanav Chakraborty</title><link>http://example.org/people/faculty/shantanavchakraborty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/people/faculty/shantanavchakraborty/</guid><description>I have been an Assistant Professor at IIIT Hyderabad since June 2021, where I am affiliated with the Centre for Quantum Science and Technology (CQST) and the Centre for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research (CSTAR).
