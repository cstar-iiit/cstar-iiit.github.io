It was provably the best algorithm for well-structured optimization tasks. such as non-smooth convex optimization in large dimensions. But then came quantum computers with their fancy superpositions, pulling off amazing feats of computation. So questions of the form &amp;ldquo;Is this the best algorithm we have?&amp;rdquo; had to be asked all over again.
In this talk we will take a look at gradient descent, at the task of non-smooth convex optimization, and we&amp;rsquo;ll show that quantum computers can&amp;rsquo;t improve upon gradient descent in general.</description></item><item><title>Functional Lower Bounds for Restricted Arithmetic Circuits of Depth Four</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/functional-lower-bounds-for-restricted-arithmetic-circuits-of-depth-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 16:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/functional-lower-bounds-for-restricted-arithmetic-circuits-of-depth-4/</guid><description>Abstract: One of the major motivations to study Arithmetic/Algebraic Circuit Complexity was due to the “slow” progress in proving lower bounds in Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on some empirical evidence, researchers believed that the power of underlying algebra and the possibility of cancellations could help understand computations on the algebraic setting.
In this talk we shall outline some of the connections between Boolean Circuit Complexity and Algebraic Circuit Complexity. In particular (by building upon some previous work [due to Yao, Beigel &amp;amp; Tarui, Forbes, Kumar &amp;amp; Saptharishi], we shall present a path towards proving stronger (nonuniform) ACC0 lower bounds via proving “functional” lower bounds in the algebraic setting.</description></item><item><title>Lower Bounds in Algebraic Circuit Complexity</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/lower_bounds_in_algebraic_circuit_complexity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/lower_bounds_in_algebraic_circuit_complexity/</guid><description>Abstract: Algebraic circuits and formulas are the standard computational models for computing multivariate polynomials. They are similar to boolean circuits and formulas except that in this case, gates are labelled by &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;. Another important model is that of an algebraic branching program (ABP), which is an intermediate model between circuits and formulas in terms of computational power. I will begin the talk by defining these models of computation formally, and then survey some of the results that have helped shape our understanding of algebraic circuits.</description></item><item><title>Shortest Paths in Time-varying Networks</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/shortest_paths_in_time_varying_networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/theory-seminar/shortest_paths_in_time_varying_networks/</guid><description>Abstract: Suppose you are given the traffic situation on each road of your city and you want to find the quickest way to your workplace from your home. The city&amp;rsquo;s road network can be modelled by a graph whose edge weights represent the amount of traffic on the roads. Now the problem boils down to computing a shortest path in this graph, which can be solved by standard algorithms (Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm, Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm).</description></item><item><title>National Quantum Science and Technology Symposium</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/nqsts-event/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/events/nqsts-event/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Algorithms &amp; Complexity</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/research-areas/algorithms-complexity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/research-areas/algorithms-complexity/</guid><description>Algorithms are fundamental objects of study in computer science. They are not only the basic building blocks of the computational world around us, but algorithmic processes are ubiquitous in nature too. In this fast-paced world we are not only satisfied with solving a task, but we would like to solve them as fast as possible. The related area of Computational Complexity theory focuses on this issue of computational efficiency. That is, it aims to quantify the amount of computational resources required to solve a given task.</description></item><item><title>Distributed &amp; Parallel Computing</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/research-areas/distributed-parallel-computing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/research-areas/distributed-parallel-computing/</guid><description>Research in parallel computing took off vigorously in the past two decades with the advent of multi-core and many-core architectures. There is now a renewed interest in designing and engineering efficient parallel algorithms targeted at a multitude of parallel architecture and platforms. Several problems from domains including graph algorithms, natural sciences, optimization, and machine learning are of particular interest owing to their wide range of applications.
Some of the fundamental outcomes of current generation research in parallel computing includes tools for analyzing and modeling GPU computations, techniques for optimizing GPU computations, engineering mechanisms to and algorithms that aim to overlap communication and computation, apart from a host of libraries, domain specific languages, and automatic compiler techniques.</description></item><item><title>Girish Varma</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/girish.varma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/girish.varma/</guid><description>Testing</description></item><item><title>Kannan Srinathan</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/kannansrinathan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/kannansrinathan/</guid><description>Testing</description></item><item><title>Pawan Kumar</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/pawankumar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/pawankumar/</guid><description>Dr. Pawan Kumar is broadly interested in numerical algorithms with applications to machine learning, computer vision, signal processing.

These machines, known as quantum computers are radically different from their classical counterparts. A major emphasis is given to the design of new algorithms that highlight the differences between classical and quantum computation in the different models of quantum computation. In the near term, we intend to develop algorithms with practical applications for quantum computers that will be available soon.</description></item><item><title>Samyadeb Bhattacharya</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/samyadebbhattacharya/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/samyadebbhattacharya/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Shantanav Chakraborty</title><link>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/shantanavchakraborty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cstar.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/shantanavchakraborty/</guid><description>I have been an Assistant Professor at IIIT Hyderabad since June 2021, where I am affiliated with the Centre for Quantum Science and Technology (CQST) and the Centre for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research (CSTAR).
