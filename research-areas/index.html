The cybersecurity field is becoming important because of the growing dependence on computers, the Internet, wireless communications standards (e.g., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), as well as the increasing number of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; IoT devices. Due to a variety of reasons, cybersecurity has become one of the major challenges of the modern IT age.</p><p>Information privacy, also known as data privacy or data protection, is the relationship between the acquisition and dispersion of users' data, technology, users' expectation of privacy, and the issues around them. Data protection is challenging to provide as data collector wants to use the collected data at the same time protecting users' preferences on personally identifiable information.</p><p>At CSTAR, we focus on developing efficient as well as secure algorithms, protocols, and techniques to enhance cybersecurity in a variety of mainstream areas of research and to protect user&rsquo;s privacy.</p></article><article><h2>Theory for Machine Learning</h2><p>In this group, we are interested in theoretical aspects of algorithms that relate specifically to machine learning and related domains such as vision. Some of the research problems consist of designing of better optimization models, solvers and provable guarantee of convergence. Learning part of machine learning often corresponds to minimizing a suitable loss function defined for a labelled data. Hence, optimization methods lies at the center of machine learning research in theory and algorithms.</p><p>We are interested in all aspects of optimization methods and solvers such as constraint optimization solvers, including optimization on manifolds, stochastic optimization, minmax problems, unconstrained optimization problems. We are currently interested in wide-ranging applications in machine learning and vision such as 3D reconstruction, image and video completion, fast and robust training for deep learning, robust algorithms for generative models, robust training for extreme classification, robust solvers for optimization problems in reinforcement learning, etc.</p><h5 id=active-members>Active Members:</h5><ul><li>Kinal Mehta</li><li>Tanmay Kumar Sinha</li></ul><h5 id=selected-papers>Selected Papers:</h5><ul><li><p>“A Deflation Based Fast and Robust Preconditioner for Bundle Adjustment”, Das, Shrutimoy and Katyan, Siddhant and Kumar, Pawan, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) pp. 1782-1789, 2021</p></li><li><p>“Two-Grid Preconditioned Solver for Bundle Adjustment”, S.

These machines, known as quantum computers are radically different from their classical counterparts. A major emphasis is given to the design of new algorithms that highlight the differences between classical and quantum computation in the different models of quantum computation. In the near term, we intend to develop algorithms with practical applications for quantum computers that will be available soon.</p><p>Furthermore, we work on the problem of communicating between several parties using quantum resources. Quantum communication offers the possibility of developing protocols that are more far more efficient and secure than their classical counterpart. We also look to advance the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, which help understand the nature of reality and form the bedrock of any quantum technological application.</p><p>In reality, quantum systems are never isolated and invariably interact with an external environment. Another direction of research pursued by our group is to explore the dynamics of quantum systems in the presence of noise. In particular, we intend to model devices such as quantum diodes and transistors which are essential ingredients to develop a quantum electronic circuit theory.</p><p>Our group is also part of the <a href=https://cqst.iiit.ac.in/>Centre for Quantum Science and Technology</a> at IIIT Hyderabad.</p><h5 id=members>Members</h5><ul><li>Shantanav Chakraborty</li><li>Indranil Chakrabarty</li><li>Samyadeb Bhattacharya</li><li>Kannan Srinathan</li></ul></article><div class=container><div class="d-flex justify-content-between py-4 my-4 border-top"><p>© 2021 IIIT Hyderabad.
