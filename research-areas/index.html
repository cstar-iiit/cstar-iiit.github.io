They are not only the basic building blocks of the computational world around us, but algorithmic processes are ubiquitous in nature too. In this fast-paced world we are not only satisfied with solving a task, but we would like to solve them as fast as possible. The related area of Computational Complexity theory focuses on this issue of computational efficiency. That is, it aims to quantify the amount of computational resources required to solve a given task.</p><p>The primary research focus of the Algorithms and Complexity group at CSTAR is on the mathematical foundations of computation. These include algorithms, combinatorics, computational complexity, coding theory and their myriad connections to mathematics.</p><h3 id=members>Members</h3><h4 id=faculty>Faculty</h4><ul><li><a href=https://suryajith.github.io/>Suryajith Chillara</a></li><li><a href=https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~kkishore>Kishore Kothapalli</a></li><li><a href=https://nitinsau.github.io/>Nitin Saurabh</a></li><li><a href=https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/srinathan/>Kannan Srinathan</a></li><li><a href=https://girishvarma.in/>Girish Varma</a></li></ul></article><article><h2>Distributed & Parallel Computing</h2><p>Research in parallel computing took off vigorously in the past two decades with the advent of multi-core and many-core architectures. There is now a renewed interest in designing and engineering efficient parallel algorithms targeted at a multitude of parallel architecture and platforms. Several problems from domains including graph algorithms, natural sciences, optimization, and machine learning are of particular interest owing to their wide range of applications.</p><p>Some of the fundamental outcomes of current generation research in parallel computing includes tools for analyzing and modeling GPU computations, techniques for optimizing GPU computations, engineering mechanisms to and algorithms that aim to overlap communication and computation, apart from a host of libraries, domain specific languages, and automatic compiler techniques. Parallel computing has also enabled several application domains such as genomics to address critical scaling challenges.</p><p>The current focus at the center in this direction is to study parallel algorithms for dynamic and static graph algorithms on centrality measures, connectivity, and shortest paths. In addition, we are focusing on applications to genomics.</p><p>A slightly related area of research is that of distributed algorithms where nodes that collaborate to perform a computation do not have access to shared memory but instead have to rely on message passing. Some of the popular models include the LOCAL and the CONGEST models; in the former nodes are allowed to send/receive message of unlimited size to their neighbors, whereas in the latter, message sizes are upper bounded to be logarithmic in the number of nodes. There have been fundamental algorithms in these models for a variety of problems including symmetry breaking in graphs, facility location problems, minimum spanning tree, and network decomposition. Decades of progress on some of these problems has resulted in a plethora of techniques to obtain lower bounds and upper bounds in a variety of models of distributed computing.</p><p>In recent years, models of distributed computing such as the k-machine model and the Massively Parallel Computing (MPC) model have shot into prominence owing to their ability to model the practical cloud computing systems. These models are based on the idea that in big data computations on the cloud, communication cost is the predominant factor compared to local computation. Hence, these models aim to reduce the number of rounds of communication needed to solve a problem while keeping message sizes to be bounded.</p><p>The current focus on distributed computing research is to design efficient algorithms in the newly emerging models such as the k-machine model and the MPC model. Of particular interest is to symmetry breaking algorithms and also studies on</p><h5 id=current-projects>Current Projects:</h5><ul><li>Parallel and Fault-resilient Programming Primitives and Algorithms for Temporal Graph Processing, National Supercomputing Mission, 2021-2023.</li><li>Design and Implementation of Parallel Algorithms and Systems for Dynamic Graphs, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, 2018-2021.</li><li>Efficient Symmetry Breaking in the CONGEST Model, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, 2018-2021.</li><li>Efficient K-mer counting using GPUs, TiH Data Science, IIIT Hyderabad, 2021-2022.</li></ul></article><article><h2>Security & Privacy</h2><p>Computer security or cybersecurity is the protection of cyber systems and computer networks from the disclosure of information, damage to physical and virtual infrastructure, electronic data, as well as from interruption of the services they provide. The cybersecurity field is becoming important because of the growing dependence on computers, the Internet, wireless communications standards (e.g., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), as well as the increasing number of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; IoT devices. Due to a variety of reasons, cybersecurity has become one of the major challenges of the modern IT age.</p><p>Information privacy, also known as data privacy or data protection, is the relationship between the acquisition and dispersion of users' data, technology, users' expectation of privacy, and the issues around them. Data protection is challenging to provide as data collector wants to use the collected data at the same time protecting users' preferences on personally identifiable information.</p><p>At CSTAR, we focus on developing efficient as well as secure algorithms, protocols, and techniques to enhance cybersecurity in a variety of mainstream areas of research and to protect user&rsquo;s privacy.</p></article><article><h2>Theory for Machine Learning</h2><p>In this group, we are interested in theoretical aspects of algorithms that relate specifically to machine learning and related domains such as vision. Some of the research problems consist of designing of better optimization models, solvers and provable guarantee of convergence. Learning part of machine learning often corresponds to minimizing a suitable loss function defined for a labelled data. Hence, optimization methods lies at the center of machine learning research in theory and algorithms.</p><p>We are interested in all aspects of optimization methods and solvers such as constraint optimization solvers, including optimization on manifolds, stochastic optimization, minmax problems, unconstrained optimization problems. We are currently interested in wide-ranging applications in machine learning and vision such as 3D reconstruction, image and video completion, fast and robust training for deep learning, robust algorithms for generative models, robust training for extreme classification, robust solvers for optimization problems in reinforcement learning, etc.</p><h5 id=active-members>Active Members:</h5><ul><li>Kinal Mehta</li><li>Tanmay Kumar Sinha</li></ul><h5 id=selected-papers>Selected Papers:</h5><ul><li><p>“A Deflation Based Fast and Robust Preconditioner for Bundle Adjustment”, Das, Shrutimoy and Katyan, Siddhant and Kumar, Pawan, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) pp. 1782-1789, 2021</p></li><li><p>“Two-Grid Preconditioned Solver for Bundle Adjustment”, S.

These machines, known as quantum computers are radically different from their classical counterparts. A major emphasis is given to the design of new algorithms that highlight the differences between classical and quantum computation in the different models of quantum computation. In the near term, we intend to develop algorithms with practical applications for quantum computers that will be available soon.</p><p>Furthermore, we work on the problem of communicating between several parties using quantum resources. Quantum communication offers the possibility of developing protocols that are more far more efficient and secure than their classical counterpart. We also look to advance the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, which help understand the nature of reality and form the bedrock of any quantum technological application.</p><p>In reality, quantum systems are never isolated and invariably interact with an external environment. Another direction of research pursued by our group is to explore the dynamics of quantum systems in the presence of noise. In particular, we intend to model devices such as quantum diodes and transistors which are essential ingredients to develop a quantum electronic circuit theory.</p><p>Our group is also part of the <a href=https://cqst.iiit.ac.in/>Centre for Quantum Science and Technology</a> at IIIT Hyderabad.</p><h5 id=members>Members</h5><ul><li>Shantanav Chakraborty</li><li>Indranil Chakrabarty</li><li>Samyadeb Bhattacharya</li><li>Kannan Srinathan</li></ul></article><div class=container><div class="d-flex justify-content-between py-4 my-4 border-top"><p>© 2021 <a href=https://iiit.ac.in>Hyderabad</a>.
